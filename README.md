## Use Instructions
We apologize that the controls are a bit clunky, as this was meant more for
our own demonstration purposes.

### Configuration Options:

#### Adjustments
* Maximum Elevation: The tallest you would want your terrain to be
* Tree Coverage: Percentage of grass tiles that will have a tree on it
* Sea Level: Any tiles below this level will be a water tile
* Apply button: Applies changes WITHOUT regenerating the height map

#### Create
* Grid Width: Number of hex tiles going horizontal
* Grid Height: Number of hex tiles going vertical
* Go button: regenerates height map
